## 7 Awesome: Free Websites to Learn Web3

## 🤝 Introduction

[7 awesome](https://blog.warengonzaga.com/series/7-awesome) is my original blog series for everything awesome I found online. In this blog series, I'm gonna share with you the best places on the internet where you can learn about the future and next generation of the internet — Web 3.0! ✨

I'm not gonna talk more about Web3 here in detail maybe on a separate blog so better to follow and subscribe to my newsletter so you won't miss out on any Web3 related content soon! 😎

Let's start! 🤘

## ✨ The 7 Awesome

**GM**, here are the top 7 awesome free websites, communities, and resources for you to learn everything about Web3. I'm sharing with you my personal Web3 favorites in top list style which I found when I was searching for Web3 knowledge. I ranked them based on my experience as a web3 student, advocate, and enthusiast. 🔥

Let's have some basic understanding of what Web3 is before we dive into the awesome list. Based on [Eshita's article](https://eshita.mirror.xyz/H5bNIXATsWUv_QbbEz6lckYcgAa2rhXEPDRkecOlCOI) she describes it like this in a simple way.

- Web1 *(read)* 😬
- Web2 *(read and write)* 😨
- Web3 *(read, write, and own)* 😱

Amazing right? We are currently in the middle of this transition from Web2 to Web3. For me, Web3 is not just hype and a bubble. Web3 is here a long time ago waiting for us to adapt, transition, and accept the future of the internet. You should start learning Web3 right now while it is early we have nothing to lose if you know both Web2 and Web3 which is better than nothing! 🤝🔥 **WAGMI**!!!

and... here's the list! enjoy! 🥰

### 📚 [BuildSpace](https://buildspace.so)

![buildspace.so](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1642064109139/mnY7xhumC.png)

Let's start this awesome list with BuildSpace! This is indeed a top place to learn and build real-world Web3 projects by doing. Why on top? BuildSpace offers different projects for you to start hacking. 🐱‍👤

Here's the motivation, you'll earn free exclusive and unique NFT when you're able to complete a project tutorial. On top of that, you'll get a special Discord role in their official Discord community to represent what you've learned and where you enroll. 🔥

For every project you completed you'll earn enough experience that leads you to get full-time work remotely on popular Web3 companies with the help of BuildSpace. 🦄

> *I can say BuildSpace nailed it, learn Web3, build Web3, and get a Web3 job*. 💡

I have a great experience inside the community that leads me to meet different popular people in the Web3 space. Thank you [@Farza](https://twitter.com/FarzaTV) for building this wonderful community!

### 📚 [Odyssey DAO](https://odysseydao.com)

![odysseydao.com](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1642064259126/MKo2oDX00.png)

Another personal favorite! 🔥 Not gonna lie, this is a good alternative to BuildSpace the only difference is that this is a learning DAO community. DAO means a decentralized autonomous organization, Odyssey has a pretty good definition of this.

[A DAO is a community that’s owned and managed by its members](https://www.odysseydao.com/articles/what-is-dao).

Here's a good thing about Odyssey, they made it possible to provide 100% free Web3 education with the help of the community around it by offering NFTs and tokens. For me, this is a great use of NFTs and tokens because you're getting NFTs and tokens for a cause, not just you want to have an NFT and tokens. 🔥 

As much as I love to support their work, their NFTs and tokens are all sold out. 😥 That's not gonna stop me from contributing, so I decided to volunteer by translating their tutorials to my first language — Filipino (Tagalog). 💡💖🚀

Odyssey has an active Discord community so better to join and start learning! 💖

Good job [@petergyang](https://twitter.com/petergyang) for making this possible! 🚀

### 📚 [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io)

![cryptozombies.io](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1642064367825/R243uNfC1.png)

Honestly, unlike BuildSpace and Odyssey, this one is a pretty good place to learn Web3 in a fun and interactive way for free. I can describe CryptoZombies as a Web3 version of Code School (Pluralsight), freeCodeCamp, or Sololearn. Plus, it is opensource! ✨

For me, It is recommended and helpful to have at least a technical background in programming, but that's not necessary or required for you to start learning blockchain development. Just go with the flow and take their courses and learn as much as possible. Huge respect to the creators ([Loom Network](https://loomx.io/)) of CryptoZombies for their efforts in creating an interactive code school just for Web3 and Blockchain developers. 💖🤝🎉

Currently, they offer 4 paths — Solidity, Advance Solidity, Chainlink, and Beyond Ethereum. Which is enough for you to be considered as a blockchain developer. With the help of these paths, you will be able to develop your smart contracts, launch NFTs, and build NFT games. Sounds cool? 😎🤘

Fun fact, the creator of CryptoZombies is also the creator of popular [EthFiddle](https://ethfiddle.com/) it is like a JSFiddle but for super cool Solidity. 🤯

### 📚 Hashnode's Web3

![web3.hashnode.com](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640097015238/uNj5ck0wZ.png)

Surprise! 😅🎉 Yes, I added to the list the very own Web3 blogs of Hashnode. Not gonna lie, the Web3 blogs are high quality and you can learn from them. Do you know what I love about Hashnode? The ability to listen to this blog! 😱 Yes, that makes it fun and convenient to learn from a Web3 audio blog like Hashnode.

This blog can be part of the Web3 blog topics under Hashnode but this is an independent blog. 😅 I want to... but you know, I need to publish something like this to be qualified. 😅

Speaking of that, Hashnode is currently looking for Web3 [bloggers](https://web3.hashnode.com/contribute/)! (tell them that I refer you 🤫)

In addition, Hashnode is currently hosting a [Web3 hackathon event](https://townhall.hashnode.com/thirdweb-hackathon) together with [thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com) at the time of this writing. So it is better to check that out and win some cool prizes. Thank me later! 🤝😀

### 📚 UseWeb3

![useweb3.xyz](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1642076684260/OGsry5iz5.png)

A great opensource community-contributed resource for Web3 enthusiasts like you. Better to check this out and bookmark it to your favorite browser because you're gonna use it on your entire Web3 journey. 🔥

It is like a simple website that has a list of very useful information related to Web3 space. Even CryptoZombies is included in their resource list! 😅 I hope I can include this blog too? 😂

No more to say, very useful Web3 resource!

### 📚 CryptoDevHub

![cryptodevhub.io](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1642076751874/XzMQ0pXz2.png)

If you like the wiki-style of learning about Web3 then this is the right place for you. CryptoDevHub is a wiki-type website where you can find tons of information about Web3. It also offers some guides for you to get started with Web3 development. Plus there is a community around it where Web3 peeps hang out by helping each other to build Web3 apps. Which is cool! 🤩

I would like to thank the webmaster [@pmmuens](https://twitter.com/pmmuens) for adding a dark mode to the website. 😂 It helps! (seriously).

### 📚 NFT School

![nftschool.dev](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1642076831473/2QsyYk9BG.png)

Here we are to the last item on our list! Please welcome, the NFT School! NFT is one of the features of Web3 so why not add it to the list. I can define NFT School as the Web3 version of W3 School but for NFTs. 🙈

Wait, what is NFT? Well, NFT stands for [Non-Fungible Tokens](https://nftschool.dev/concepts/non-fungible-tokens/#a-bit-of-history). I'm not gonna discuss this here, this deserves a separate blog. To keep it simple, NFTs are just like a ticket to a concert where you can buy it and keep it forever and you might sell it to collectors in the future since it has value, the same idea with paintings and artworks. Buy the digital copy of it and keep it for yourself or sell it to collectors. 😎

Bookmark this website as a resource if you're into the NFT journey! 😉

## 🐱‍👤 Last Words

That's pretty much everything about free Web3 resources. I compiled the best free resources possible so you can start learning right away. 😎🤝 I would suggest, start your journey with the hashtag #100DayOfWeb3 on Twitter, joining Web3 communities, or get a job at a Web3 company. 🦄

The time of this writing is the exact day 30 of my #100DaysOfWeb3 journey (yey 🎉). It is surprising that I learned so fast for the past 30 days. How do I do that? Well, I'm gonna write a separate blog for that! 😅

If you have any Web3 resources that we should know, kindly comment below! 🤝

Before you leave, why not check the bonus content below? 😅

### 🚀 Bonus Content

What if I tell you, you can build Web3 applications without coding? (I know you're laughing right now, that's fine, no worries 😅) 

That's actually possible with the help of the [thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com)! 🤫✨

%[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH__geAgkxI]

I'm a general community manager at thirdweb and I would like to include this in this blog as it helps a traditional Web2 developer like me to transition to Web3 space. It is actually awesome because it enables no-code developers to participate in Web3 space without knowing Solidity or Rust to interact with smart contracts. Aside from being a no-code platform, you can actually use the programming language you already know such as JavaScript, Python, and much more... just to build some Web3 cool stuff! 🔥

Check out [this awesome guide](https://thirdweb.com/portal/guides/release-an-nft-drop-with-no-code) to get started! Don't forget to bookmark our [developers portal](https://thirdweb.com/portal/) for you to learn and start creating Web3 apps without writing any solidity or rust. 🤝

At this moment, we're currently giving away [free NFT (Silver Early Access Cards)](https://thirdweb.com/early) to the first 100,000 users to mint it. Hurry!!! Don't forget to join our [community](https://discord.gg/thirdweb) too! 🤯✨

Thanks for reading, good luck with your Web3 journey! 💖
